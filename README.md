# README: Nutrition Analysis AI

## Introduction  
The **Nutrition Analysis AI** is a Flask-based web application designed to evaluate users' daily food intake, generate a **health rating**, and provide **personalized nutritional insights**. It allows users to select foods for different meals and receive an analysis of nutrient intake, **identify deficiencies**, and get suggestions for improving their diet.  

The application uses **data visualization techniques** such as pie charts and bar graphs to display nutrient distribution and suggest foods that best cover the identified deficiencies.  

---

## Features  
### ðŸ”¹ Food Selection  
Users can input their daily meals by selecting food items for **breakfast, lunch, snacks, and dinner**.  

### ðŸ”¹ Nutrition Analysis  
The app computes the total intake of various nutrients and **identifies deficiencies**.  

### ðŸ”¹ Health Rating  
A **normalized health rating** is calculated based on the **Nutrition Density** of the selected foods, on a scale of **0 to 10**.  

### ðŸ”¹ Nutrient Deficiency Detection  
The app determines nutrients that fall below **50% of the average intake**, labeling them as **deficient**.  

### ðŸ”¹ Food Suggestions  
For each deficient nutrient, **top 3 foods** rich in those nutrients are suggested.  

### ðŸ”¹ Top 5 Foods for Nutritional Balance  
The app identifies the **top 5 foods** that cover most of the deficiencies and presents them in a **bar chart**.  

### ðŸ”¹ Data Visualization  
- **Pie Chart** for **nutrient distribution**.  
- **Bar Chart** for **nutrient breakdown**.  
- **Top 5 Deficiency-Covering Foods Chart**.  

### ðŸ”¹ Model Performance Comparison  
The app includes pre-generated **ML model performance** visualizations for **Random Forest, LightGBM, and SVC**.

## Installation and Setup  

### Prerequisites  
Ensure you have the following installed on your system:  
- Python 3.x  
- Flask (`pip install Flask`)  
- Pandas (`pip install pandas`)  
- Matplotlib (`pip install matplotlib`)  

### Steps to Install and Run  

1. **Clone the repository**  
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/nutrition-analysis-app.git
   cd nutrition-analysis-app
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**  
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run the Flask app**

## Key Functionalities  

### ðŸ”¹ Data Processing  
- The app reads **FOOD-DATA-GROUP11.csv**, which contains food items with **nutrient values** and a **Nutrition Density** score.  
- User-selected foods are **filtered**, and total nutrient intake is computed.  

### ðŸ”¹ Health Rating Calculation  
- The app **normalizes** the **Nutrition Density** score based on the highest available density.  
- The health rating is computed as:  
  \[
  \text{Normalized Rating} = \left( \frac{\sum \text{Selected Food Densities}}{\text{Total Selected Items} \times \text{Max Density}} \right) \times 10
  \]
- The final rating is **capped between 0 and 10**.  

### ðŸ”¹ Identifying Deficient Nutrients  
- Nutrients **below 50% of the mean intake** are marked as deficient.  
- A list of these nutrients is generated.  

### ðŸ”¹ Food Recommendations  
- **Top 3 foods** rich in each deficient nutrient are suggested.  
- **Top 5 foods** covering most deficiencies are determined and displayed using a bar chart.  

### ðŸ”¹ Data Visualization  
- **Pie Chart** for nutrient distribution.  
- **Bar Chart** for nutrient breakdown.  
- **Bar Chart for top 5 deficiency-covering foods**.
